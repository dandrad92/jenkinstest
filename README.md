# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Docker and AWS

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline implementation using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS. It showcases automated build, test, and deployment processes for containerized applications following DevOps best practices.

## Key Features
- **Jenkins Pipeline as Code**: Complete CI/CD workflow defined in Jenkinsfile
- **Containerization**: Docker integration for consistent build environments
- **Automated Testing**: Unit and integration testing stages
- **AWS Deployment**: Automated deployment to AWS infrastructure
- **Security Scanning**: Container and dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Notification System**: Pipeline status alerts and reporting

## Technical Components
- **Jenkins Configuration**: Custom Jenkins setup with necessary plugins
- **Docker Integration**: Multi-stage Dockerfile for optimal builds
- **Pipeline Stages**: Build, Test, Scan, Deploy, and Verify
- **AWS Infrastructure**: ECS/ECR configuration for container deployment
- **Monitoring Integration**: Pipeline performance monitoring

```

## Pipeline Workflow
1. **Code Checkout**: Pull latest code from GitHub
2. **Build**: Compile code and build Docker container
3. **Unit Tests**: Run automated tests in isolated container
4. **Security Scan**: Check for vulnerabilities in code and dependencies
5. **Publish**: Push container image to AWS ECR
6. **Deploy**: Update AWS ECS service with new container
7. **Verification**: Confirm successful deployment and application health

## Local Development Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/dandrad92/jenkinstest.git
cd jenkinstest

# Run development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Execute tests
docker-compose exec app npm test
```

## Jenkins Configuration
This project requires Jenkins with the following plugins:
- Docker Pipeline
- AWS Steps
- Blue Ocean
- Slack Notification

Pipeline credentials needed:
- AWS credentials
- Docker registry authentication
- GitHub access token

## Deployment Architecture
The application is deployed as containerized microservices on AWS ECS with:
- Load balancing through AWS ALB
- Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
- Blue/Green deployment strategy for zero-downtime updates
- CloudWatch monitoring and alerting

## Performance Metrics
- Average build time: ~3 minutes
- Deployment frequency: Multiple times per day
- Change failure rate: <5%
- Mean time to recovery: <30 minutes

## Future Enhancements
- Implement infrastructure as code with Terraform
- Add canary deployment strategy
- Integrate advanced security scanning
- Implement automated rollback mechanisms
